# Bioinformatics material
This is an initial deployment of a website focused on understanding fundamental bioinformatics concepts. It's currently under construction, so you might encounter some typos :(. The platform  includes essential materials for Bioinformatics, with a focus on computation. It is organized into four sections: Bioinformatics, Concise statistics, Blog, and DRAC.

### [Bioinformatics](bioinfo/bioinfo_overview.md) 
(Under construction): The section contains materials designed to refresh foundational knowledge in Bioinformatics, with an emphasis on understanding core concepts.
    
### [Concise statistics](stat/stat_overview.md)
(Under construction): This section covers general statistical concepts that may be useful for students.

   
### [Blog](blog/index.md)
I have compiled general posts here that are useful for both students and researchers.

### [DRAC](drac/index.md)
I have compiled posts that are particularly useful for students and researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital (Neuro) who frequently use DRAC.
