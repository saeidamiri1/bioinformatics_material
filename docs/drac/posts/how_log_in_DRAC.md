Current research, especially for Bioinformatics, the coding may not be done solely using a specifics programming language e.g., R and will likely use different programming languages; hence, having a modern integrated development environment (IDE) is very important. Vscode editor is a modern IDE that is developed by
microsoft. I used it as text editor and coding, I am pretty sure you will like.  Do the following steps to have a standard editor.
